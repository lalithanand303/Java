# React_Mywebsite

I am going to create a web page for my Self and latter I will create some other applications too.
1)I will first create my document which will say my entire bio data. first my aim is to create a sign page for the candidate login and I will locally set some Id and password to that page, people who have those details they will easily access that page. when a person enters into that page he will see some data about me.
2) I will create four labels in my page they are personal information, address and employment, educational back ground, areas of interest, 
3) thank you page which has a small greeting to the visited people.
